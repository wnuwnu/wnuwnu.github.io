      <description>AJonP - Purr-fect Solutions Something was a miss with my old site, I just couldn&amp;rsquo;t care to ever update it. I was bored by trying to constantly fight with Wordpress issues, updates, plugins&amp;hellip;
At the same time I was hanging around my favorite Slack channel Angular Firebase and Jeff mentions he is building an awesome CMS with Hugo, called fireship.io.
My initial thought was I am an Angular developer, why would I go back to creating static sites, are people ðŸ¦‡ ðŸ’© crazy!</description>
